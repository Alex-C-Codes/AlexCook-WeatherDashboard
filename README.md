## Weather Dashboard by Alex Cook

This app allows people to search for a city and then find current weather conditions in that city as well as forecasted future weather conditions for that city. The dates, icons representing the day's weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed are shown for each forecasted date and the current day. Moreover, once a city is searched, that city is added to the search history. People can click on the searched city within the search history to be presented again with current and future weather conditions.
